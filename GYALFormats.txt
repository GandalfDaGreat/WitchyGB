Stream format:

%00XXXXXX -> New note:
	X = note number
	(for noise channel, the next byte will be used for polynomial ($FF22) )
%01XXXXXX -> Empty rows:
	X = no. of empty rows
%10A-ZXYY -> New envelope: 
	A = set to 1 if there is another instruction this row
	Z = 1 for envelope on, 0 for envelope off
	X = 1 for looping envelope, 0 for no loop
	Y = No. of envelope (see envelope list below)
	Next two bytes = address of envelope
%11XAYY-- -> Set duty/vol env or volume(for wave):
	A = set to 1 if there is another instruction this row
	X = 1 for duty, 0 for volume envelope
	Y = duty value, or volume value for wave channel
%111AYYYY -> Set new wavetable, wave channel only
	A = set to 1 if there is another instruction this row
	Y = wavetable number
%00000000 -> Note off
%11111111 -> Jump:
	Next two bytes = New address

Start of stream:

The first 11 bytes of the music stream should be (in this order)

Song Speed (the higher the number the slower)
Channel 1 stream address
Channel 2 stream address
Channel 3 stream address
Channel 4 stream address
Wavetable list address

Envelope list:

Channel 1+2:
1. Pitch 
2. Duty 
3. Arpeggio

Channel 3:
1. Pitch
2. Volume
3. Arpeggio

Channel 4:
NONE

Envelope format:

%0XXXXXXX -> Repeats:
	X = Number of repeats of previous value
%01111111 -> End of Envelope
%1XXXXXXX -> Output value:
	X = Value
%1YXXXXXX -> Output value for pitch envelope only:
	Y = Sign bit

SFX format:

%0000XXXX -> Register number (see below), next byte is the data for that register
%xxxxxxxx -> Number of empty frames, nibbles are swapped (cannot be $FF)
%11111111 -> End of stream
