## Information

Included in the project is a custom GameBoy audio library (GYAL) which can be used in other GameBoy games/applications.
GYAL uses custom formats for the music and sound effect data which are detailed in 'GYALFormats.txt'. GYAL was inspired by the Famitone library for NES by Shiru: http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?t=7329
